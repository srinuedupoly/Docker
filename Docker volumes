In Docker, both bind mounts and volumes are used to persist data generated or used by Docker containers. While they serve similar purposes, they differ in implementation, flexibility, and use cases. Here’s an explanation of both along with examples:

Bind Mounts:
Bind mounts allow you to mount a file or directory from the host filesystem into a container. This method directly references a location on the host machine.

Use Cases
When you need to access and share configuration files.
For development environments where you want to immediately see changes made to the source code on the host machine inside the container.

Example

docker run -d --name nginx-bind -v /path/to/local/folder:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx

-d runs the container in detached mode.
--name specifies the container name as nginx-bind.
-v /path/to/local/folder:/usr/share/nginx/html mounts the local directory /path/to/local/folder to /usr/share/nginx/html inside the container.


Volume Mounts:
Volumes are managed by Docker and are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker (/var/lib/docker/volumes/ on Linux). Volumes are more flexible than bind mounts and provide advantages such as the ability to easily backup, restore, and transfer data between Docker hosts.

Use Cases
When you need persistent data storage that is not dependent on the lifecycle of a specific container.
For data sharing among multiple containers.
When you want Docker to manage the data location.

Example
Creating a Volume

docker volume create myvolume 

Using the Volume in a Container

docker run -d --name nginx-volume -v myvolume:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
-d runs the container in detached mode.
--name specifies the container name as nginx-volume.
-v myvolume:/usr/share/nginx/html mounts the Docker-managed volume myvolume to /usr/share/nginx/html inside the container.


Differences Between Bind Mounts and Volumes


Management:

Bind Mounts: Directly references host filesystem paths. Requires full paths.
Volumes: Managed by Docker, stored in Docker’s storage locations. Easier to manage, backup, and migrate.
Portability:

Bind Mounts: Less portable as they depend on specific paths on the host machine.
Volumes: More portable since Docker manages the location. Ideal for multi-host environments.
Performance:

Bind Mounts: Performance can vary depending on the filesystem.
Volumes: Generally optimized by Docker for performance.
Security:

Bind Mounts: Less secure as they expose the host filesystem directly to the container.
Volumes: More secure as Docker abstracts the storage location.

docker run jenkins/jenkins

docker ps

docker inspect <conatiner name/id> - To know the internal IP - networks section

docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins



docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /root/mydata:/var/jenkins_home  jenkins/jenkins

docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /root/mydata:/var/jenkins_home -u root jenkins/jenkins  -- To run using root user


create a test job

stop the container

docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /root/mydata:/var/jenkins_home -u root jenkins/jenkins  -- rerun 

already data will be available

bind mounting:

mkdir host_config
echo "This is a config file" > host_config/config.txt


docker run -v $(pwd)/host_config:/container/config -it ubuntu


cd /container/config
ls


echo "This is an updated config file" > host_config/config.txt


cat /container/config/config.txt

--------------------------------------------------------
volume mounting:

docker volume create my_volume

docker run -v my_volume:/container/data -it ubuntu
cd /container/data
touch myfile.txt

echo "This is a file created on the host system" > /var/lib/docker/volumes/my_volume/_data/host_file.txt


cat /container/data/host_file.txt
